## 🎯 Objective

To identify sneaker products with significant quality issues by analyzing **damage grades** (A–E) and evaluating their impact on **unsold inventory**, enabling better product, quality, and inventory decisions.

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Sneakers are graded from **A (best)** to **E (worst)**.
- Products like **Lacoste Carnaby Evo** and **Superga 2750 Cotu Classic** show a **high proportion of Grade A units**, indicating superior quality.
- **Adidas Originals Samba OG**, **Air Jordan 1 Mid**, and **ASICS Gel-Quantum 90** show the **highest damage counts across all grades**.
- These same products also top the list of **unsold inventory**, showing a direct link between poor quality and stockpile buildup.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** – Data analysis and EDA
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and interactive filtering
- **Microsoft Excel** – Basic data handling
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Code and narrative explanation
- **PowerPoint** – Executive summary

---

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights (Power BI)

- **Damage Rate by Grade (A–E)**: Visual breakdown per sneaker product
- **Top Damaged Products**: Ranked by total defect counts
- **Highest Unsold Inventory**: Products with excess stock, categorized by grade
- **Filters**: Slice data by product or sneaker grade

---

## ✅ Strategic Recommendations

1. **Investigate damage causes** in high-risk products.
2. **Enhance quality control** in Adidas and Air Jordan lines.
3. **Clear or redesign** low-performing inventory.
4. **Promote high-grade sneakers** for better customer perception.
5. **Monitor KPIs** on quality and stock quarterly.
